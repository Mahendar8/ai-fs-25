            <p class="para">The "GT3" nameplate was introduced in 1999 as part of the first generation of the Porsche 996 model range (commonly known as 996.1[2]) as a homologation model for the cars entered in the FIA GT3 cup. As with Porsche's previous 911 RS models, the 996 GT3 was focused on racing, and so was devoid of items that added unnecessary weight to the car. Sound deadening was almost completely removed, as were the rear seats, rear loud speakers, sunroof, and air conditioning, although automatic air conditioning and CD/radio became no-cost optional add-ons.
The engine of the 996 GT's and Turbo set it apart from 996 Carrera models, as it shared nothing with the standard so-called "integrated dry sump" (e.g. wet-sump) flat-six engine used in the water-cooled 996 Carrera engine introduced in MY1999. The 996 GT engine is naturally aspirated and based on "The Mezger" racing engine used in the 962 and 911 GT1 race cars. That engine was known as the 'Mezger' engine, after its designer Hans Mezger. The engine uses the original air-cooled 911's versatile dry-sump crankcase, with an external oil reservoir. The 996 GT3 has 265 kW; 355 hp (360 PS), compared to the 221 kW; 296 hp (300 PS) of the standard 996. In GT3 configuration, this so-called "split" crankcase (meaning the parting line of crankcase is on the crankshaft centreline) uses, instead of a fan and finned cylinders, separate water jackets added onto each side of the crankcase to cool banks of three cylinders with water pumped through a radiator. Thus, the GT3 engine is very similar to the completely water-cooled 962 racing car's engine, which is based on the same crankcase. The 962 differs, however, by using six individual cylinder heads while the "Mezger" (GT1 engine block) uses two cylinder heads, each covering a bank of three cylinders. The GT3 engine could thus also be thought of as similar to a 959 engine, but with water-cooled crankcase. Up until model year 2004 996 production, the basic casting used for the "Mezger" crankcase of the GT3 was the same as the 996 GT1 LeMans cars, and the same "964.." block part-number is visible on the bottom of the crankcase. Beginning with MY2004 however, production was outsourced to Valmet facilities in Spain, France, and Austria, and all subsequent road-legal Mezger engines are part-numbered "996.." (even on later 997 cars).
Because the GT1 Mezger block uses the same legacy Porsche 356 engine to transmission mounting flange configuration, the 996 GT3 used a 6-speed manual gearbox also of air-cooled 911 heritage. This new G96/50 gearbox has interchangeable gear ratios and is more durable making it more suitable for racing than the standard type 996 Carrera's gearbox.[3]
To bring the vehicle's track-prowess to the maximum level, Porsche endowed the GT3 with enlarged brakes, a lowered, re-tuned suspension system, lighter-weight wheels and a new front bumper with matched rear spoiler to help increase downforce, thereby increasing grip.</p>
